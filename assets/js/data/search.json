By using HTTP headers we can set variouslevels of authentication and permission tooWorld Wide Web The Internet is a system of interconnected computer networks that hasexisted since at least the 1960s 1989 when a research scientist at CERN Tim Berners-Lee, invented HTTP and ushered in the modern World WideWeb. His great insight was that the existing hypertext system, wheretext displayed on a computer screen contained links (hyperlinks) toother documents, could be moved onto the internet.His invention, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), was the firststandard, universal way to share documents over the internet.URLS A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a resource on the internet. For example, the Google homepage lives at https://www.google.com. request and response pattern is the basis of all webcommunication. client (typically a web browser) requests information server responds with a response. https://python.org/about/ https, refers to the scheme used. it could also be ftp for files, smtp for email, and so on. python.org is the host name an (optional) path - /about/Internet Protocol Suite Once we know the actual URL of a resource, a whole collection of othertechnologies must work properly (together) to connect the client withthe server and load an actual webpage. This is broadly referred to as theinternet protocol suite(DNS) to translate the domain name google.com into an IP address Domain names are used because it iseasier for humans to remember a domain name like google.com thanan IP address like 172.217.164.68.After the browser has the IP address for a given domain, it needs a wayto set up a consistent connection with the desired server. This happensvia the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which provides reliable,ordered, and error-checked delivery of bytes between two application.To establish a TCP connection between two computers, a three-way handshake occurs between the client and server: The client sends a SYN asking to establish a connection The server responds with a SYN-ACK acknowledging the request and passing a connection parameter The client sends an ACK back to the server confirming the connection HTTP Verbs Every webpage contains both an address (the URL) as well as a list ofapproved actions known as HTTP verbs. So far we’ve mainly talkedabout getting a web page, but it’s also possible to create, edit, and delete content CRUD HTTP Versbs Create POST Read GET Update PUT Delete DELETE To create content you use POST, to read content GET, to update it PUT, and to delete it you use DELETEEndpoints A traditional website consists of web pages with HTML, CSS, images,JavaScript, and more. There is a dedicated URL, such asexample.com/1/, for each page. A web API also relies on URLs and acorresponding one might be example.com/api/1/, but instead ofserving up web pages consumable by humans it produces API endpoints.An endpoints contains data, typically in the JSON format, and also a listof available actions (HTTP verbs).GET returns all usershttps://www.mysite.com/api/users/api/users, an available GET request returns list of all available users. This type of endpoint which returns multiple data resources is known as a collection.GET returns a single userhttps://www.mysite.com/api/users/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;**/api/users/**, represents a single user. AGET request returns information about just that one user. If we added a POST to the first endpoint we could create a new user,while adding DELETE to the second endpoint would allow us to deletea single userHTTP HTTP is a request-response protocol between two computers that have anexisting TCP connection.HTTP Message: status line headers optional body dataRequestGET / HTTP/1.1Host: google.comAccept_Language: en-USThere are many HTTP Headers availableresponseHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Mon, 24 Jan 2022 23:26:07 GMTServer: gwsAccept-Ranges: bytesContent-Length: 13Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8Hello, world!Status Codes Once your web browser has executed an HTTP Request on a URL thereis no guarantee things will actually work!

Status Code Means 2xx Success 3xx Redirection 4xx Client Error 5xx Server Error Statelessness stateless protocol. This means each request/response pair is completely independent of the previous oneStatelessness brings a lot of benefits to HTTP. Since all electroniccommunication systems have signal loss over time, if we did not have astateless protocol, things would constantly break if one request/response cycle didn’t go through. As a result, HTTP is known as a veryresilient distributed protocol." }, { "title": "Instance Static Class Methods in a Nutshell", "url": "/yusufadell/posts/static-class-method-in-nutshell/", "categories": "Python", "tags": "python", "date": "2022-04-08 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Instance - Static - Class Methodsinstance - static - class and propetry methods pythonclass MyClass: # obj = MyClass # Same as MyClass().method(obj) def method(the_object): return &#39;instance method called&#39; the_object @classmethod def classmethod(the_class): return &#39;class method called&#39; the_class @staticmethod def staticmethod(): return &#39;static method called&#39; @property def nm(self): return &#39;property called&#39;Please note that naming these parameters self and cls is just aconvention.

All that matters is that they’repositioned first in the parameter list for that particular method.obj = MyClass()print(obj.method())without the syntactic sugar provided by the obj.method() dot-call syntaxprint(same as MyClass.method(obj))print(obj.classmethod())This confirms that static methods can neither access the object in-stance state nor the class state. They work like regular functions but belong to the class’(and every instance’s) namespace.print(obj.staticmethod())Flagging a method as a static method is not just a hint that a methodwon’t modify class or instance state. As you’ve seen this restriction isalso enforced by the Python runtime.Key Takeaways Instance methods need a class instance and can access the instance through self. Class methods don’t need a class instance. They can’t access theinstance (self) but they have access to the class itself via cls. Static methods don’t have access to cls or self. They work likeregular functions but belong to the class’ namespace. Static and class methods communicate and (to a certain degree)enforce developer intent about class design. This can have def-inite maintenance benefits.

It lets you create child classes thatinherit the methods of their parent classes. You can override the methodsto provide new code for them but also use the super() function to call theoriginal methods in the parent class. A child class has an “is a” relationshipwith its parent class, because an object of the child class is a kind of objectof the parent class.In Python, using classes and inheritance is optional. Some program-mers see the complexity that heavy use of inheritance creates as not worthits benefits. It’s often more flexible to use composition instead of inheri-tance, because it implements a “has a” relationship with an object of oneclass and objects of other classes rather than inheriting methods directlyfrom those other classes. This means that objects of one class can have anobject of another class. For example, a Customer object could have a birthdatemethod that is assigned a Date object rather than the Customer class subclass-ing Date.Just as type() can return the type of the object passed to it, the i­ sinstance()and issubclass() functions return type and inheritance information aboutthe object passed to them.Classes can have object methods and attributes, but they can also haveclass methods, class attributes, and static methods. Although these arerarely used, they can enable other object-oriented techniques that globalvariables and functions can’t provide.Python lets classes inherit from multiple parents, although this can leadto code that is difficult to understand. The super() function and a class’smethods figure out how to inherit methods based on the MRO. You canview a class’s MRO in the interactive shell by calling the mro() method onthe class.This chapter and the previous one covered general OOP concepts. Inthe next chapter, we’ll explore Python-specific OOP techniques." }, { "title": "Why not to use Inheritance", "url": "/yusufadell/posts/Why-not-to-use-inthereiance/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "python, programming", "date": "2022-03-30 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "It’s easy to overengineer your classes using inheritance. As LucianoRamalho states, “Placing objects in a neat hierarchy appeals to our senseof order; programmers do it just for fun.” We’ll create classes, subclasses,and sub-subclasses when a single class, or a couple of functions in a mod-ule, would achieve the same effect. But recall the Zen of Python tenet inChapter 6 that simple is better than complex.Using OOP allows you to organize your code into smaller units (in thiscase, classes) that are easier to reason about than one large .py file with hun-dreds of functions defined in no particular order. Inheritance is useful ifyou have several functions that all operate on the same dictionary or listdata structure. In that case, it’s beneficial to organize them into a class.But here are some examples of when you don’t need to create a class oruse inheritance: If your class consists of methods that never use the self or cls param-eter, delete the class and use functions in place of the methods.• If you’ve created a parent with only a single child class but never createobjects of the parent class, you can combine them into a single class. If you create more than three or four levels of subclasses, you’re prob-ably using inheritance unnecessarily. Combine those subclasses intofewer classes. As the non-OOP and OOP versions of the tic-tac-toe program in theprevious chapter illustrate, it’s certainly possible to not use classes and stillhave a working, bug-free program. Don’t feel that you have to design yourprogram as some complex web of classes. A simple solution that works is bet-ter than a complicated solution that doesn’t. Joel Spolsky writes about this inhis blog post, “Don’t Let the Astronaut Architects Scare You” at https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/.You should know how object-oriented concepts like inheritance work,because they can help you organize your code and make development anddebugging easier.

Consider the following set of functions that need to checkwhether the username they receive as an argument is the admin or not and,if the user is not an admin, raise an exception:class Store: def get_food(self, username, food): if username != &#39;admin&#39;: raise Exception(&quot;This user is not allowed to get food&quot;) return self.storage.get(food) def put_food(self, username, food): if username != &#39;admin&#39;: raise Exception(&quot;This user is not allowed to put food&quot;) self.storage.put(food)We can see there’s some repeated code here. The obvious first step tomaking this code more efficient is to factor the code that checks for adminstatus:def check_is_admin(username): if username != &#39;admin&#39;: raise Exception(&quot;This user is not allowed to get or put food&quot;)class Store: def get_food(self, username, food): check_is_admin(username) return self.storage.get(food) def put_food(self, username, food): check_is_admin(username) self.storage.put(food)We’ve moved the checking code into its own function u. Now our codelooks a bit cleaner, but we can do even better if we use a decorator.def check_is_admin(f): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): if kwargs.get(&#39;username&#39;) != &#39;admin&#39;: raise Exception(&quot;This user is not allowed to get or put food&quot;) return f(*args, **kwargs) return wrapperclass Store: @check_is_admin def get_food(self, username, food): return self.storage.get(food) @check_is_admin def put_food(self, username, food): self.storage.put(food)We define our check_is_admin decorator and then call it wheneverwe need to check for access rights. The decorator inspects the argumentspassed to the function using the kwargs variable and retrieves the usernameargument, performing the username check before calling the actual func-tion. Using decorators like this makes it easier to manage common func-tionality. To anyone with much Python experience, this is probably old hat,but what you might not realize is that this naive approach to implementingdecorators has some major drawbacks.Stacking DecoratorsYou can also use several decorators on top of a single function or method.def check_user_is_not(username): def user_check_decorator(f): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): if kwargs.get(&#39;username&#39;) == username: raise Exception(&quot;This user is not allowed to get food&quot;) return f(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper return user_check_decoratorclass Store: @check_user_is_not(&quot;admin&quot;) @check_user_is_not(&quot;user123&quot;) def get_food(self, username, food): return self.storage.get(food)Here, check_user_is_not() is a factory function for our decorator user​_check_decorator(). It creates a function decorator that depends on theusername variable and then returns that variable. The function user_check​_decorator() will serve as a function decorator for get_food(). The function get_food() gets decorated twice using check_user_is_not().The question here is which username should be checked first—admin or user123?class Store: def get_food(self, username, food): return self.storage.get(food)Store.get_food = check_user_is_not(&quot;user123&quot;)(Store.get_food)Store.get_food = check_user_is_not(&quot;admin&quot;)(Store.get_food)The decorator list is applied from top to bottom, so the decoratorsclosest to the def keyword will be applied first and executed last. In theexample above, the program will check for admin first and then for user123.In the part 3 we’ll see if It’s also possible to implement class decorators" }, { "title": "When you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know!", "url": "/yusufadell/posts/When-you-don-t-know-what-you-don-t-know/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "programming, tutorial", "date": "2022-03-27 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "There’s a certain class of problems that kind of fascinates me and I’d describe them as not knowing what you don’t know.

You could say it’s involuntary ignorance or unawareness of common knowledge. It’s something that you don’t know, that everybody else seems to know, and because everybody else seems to know it they assume you couldn’t possibly not know it. If I had to list the features of the problem it’d look like this: Very hard to discover the solution Once you discover the solution, fixing the problem is usually trivial The solutions are always obvious in retrospect The solutions are already widely known by othersI have several examples of this happening in my life. The first and best example is when I was 10. In school I was failing history tests but doing well on every other subject. A poor grade would be something like &amp;lt; 75/100. I was getting scores in the 20s/100. Basically bottom 1st percentile stuff. The school was calling my parents, suggesting maybe I should be moved to a different school. The school and my parents IQ tested me three times. I underwent a battery of tests, such as neurological, vision, hearing, psychological, etc.Apparently many thousands of dollars were spent trying to find the underlying problem. The solution came from a child psychologist who figured out that I didn’t understand the concept of studying. I didn’t know I could or was supposed to prepare for these tests by repeatedly reviewing the material so I would memorize it. Nobody had told me about it and I had never done it before. I guess the subject never came up in conversations with friends, or if it did maybe I thought studying meant something different. I really have no idea how other people figured this out on their own. Naturally the solution was to get a tutor and my next score on these tests was 96/100. This issue was immediately resolved and never happened again.A more relatable and general example is someone who mispronounces words because he learned it on his own by reading.There’s really no doubt that this kind of problem must be generally pervasive in every functional area of life. Social, academic, professional, health, romantic, etc. For some people, the difference in between success and mediocrity may come down to unawareness of some common knowledge that plays an important functional role.I don’t really have firm recommendations on detecting of fixing these sorts of problems. The most I can say is that in my experience the people most likely to point out these common-sense solutions are either mentors, trusted friends, or hired consultants. They will generally provide you honest feedback that others wouldn’t for risk of offending you." }, { "title": "How to Learn Any Programming Language?", "url": "/yusufadell/posts/How-to-learn-anyprogramming-language/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "programming, tutorial", "date": "2022-03-19 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "How to Learn Any Programming LanguageI’m going to teach you how to learn most of the programming languages you may want to learn inthe future. This is based on how I and many other programmers learn newlanguages. The process that I usually follow is as follows: Get a book or some introductory text about the language. Go through the book and type in all of the code, making all of it run. Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes. Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language. Read other people’s code in the language, and try to copy their patterns. In this book, I forced you to go through this process very slowly and in small chunks. Other books aren’torganized the same way, and this means you have to extrapolate how I’ve made you do this to how theircontent is organized. The best way to do this is to read the book lightly and make a list of all the majorcode sections. Turn this list into a set of exercises based on the chapters, and then simply do them inorder one at a time.The preceding process also works for new technologies, assuming they have books you can read. Foranything without books, you do the above process but use online documentation or source code as yourinitial introduction.Each new language you learn makes you a better programmer, and as you learn more languages theybecome easier to learn. By your third or fourth language you should be able to pick up similar languagesin a week, with stranger languages taking longer. Now that you know Python you could potentially learnRuby and JavaScript fairly quickly by comparison. This is simply because many languages share similarconcepts, and once you learn the concepts in one language they work in others.The ﬁnal thing to remember about learning a new language is this: Don’t be a stupid tourist. A stupidtourist is someone who goes to another country and then complains that the food isn’t like the food athome (“Why can’t I get a good burger in this stupid country?!”). When you’re learning a new language,assume that what it does isn’t stupid, it’s just diﬀerent, and embrace it so you can learn it.After you learn a language, though, don’t be a slave to that language’s way of doing things. Sometimesthe people who use a language actually do some very idiotic things for no other reason than “that’s howwe’ve always done it.” If you like your style better and you know how everyone else does it, then feel freeto break their rules if it improves things.I really enjoy learning new programming languages. I think of myself as a “programmer anthropologist”and think of languages as little insights about the group of programmers who use them. I’m learning alanguage they all use to talk to each other through computers, and I ﬁnd this fascinating. Then again,I’m kind of a weird guy, so just learn programming languages because you want to.Enjoy!This is really fun stuﬀ." }, { "title": "Open Source is Not About You", "url": "/yusufadell/posts/OpenSource-Is-Not-About-You/", "categories": "Tutorial", "tags": "open-source", "date": "2022-02-14 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Open Source is Not About YouThe only people entitled to say how open source ‘ought’ to work are people who run projects, and thescope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status,focus and eﬀort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all.

You are not entitled to this explanation.If you have expectations (of others) that aren’t being met, those expectations are your own responsibility.You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software andthe right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of ‘community-driven-development’ are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work,a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things can work and apervasive sense of communal entitlement.If you think Cognitect is not doing anything for the community, or is not listening to the community, you aresimply wrong. You are not, however, entitled to it being the eﬀort, focus or response you desire. We get tomake our own choices as regards our time and lives.We at Cognitect have to show up to work, every day, to make a living. We get no royalties of any kind fromClojure. We are in no way building Clojure for proﬁt. Far fewer than 1% of Clojure users are our consultingor product customers, and thus contributing to our livelihood.We take some of what we earn, money that could e.g. go into our retirement savings and instead use it tohire people to work on Clojure and community outreach, some full-time. To be honest, I could use thatmoney in my retirement account, having depleted it to make Clojure in the ﬁrst place. But I love workingwith the team on Clojure, and am proud of the work we do.Alex Miller is extremely attentive to and engaged with the Clojure community. He and Stu Halloway and Iregularly meet and discuss community issues. Alex, at my direction, spends the majority of his time eitherworking on features for the community or assessing patches and bug reports. I spend signiﬁcant portionsof my time designing these features - spec, tools.deps, error handling and more to come. This is time takenaway from earning a living.I am grateful for the contributions of the community. Every Clojure release incorporates manycontributions. The vast majority of the user community doesn’t contribute, and doesn’t desire tocontribute. And that’s ﬁne. Open source is a no-strings-attached gift, and all participants should recognizeit as such.The Clojure process is not closed, but it is conservative. I think Clojure beneﬁts greatly from thatconservatism, in contrast to some other projects with high churn rates and feature bloat. If you disagree orimagine otherwise, that’s too bad. It’s my life and I’m not going to spend it arguing/negotiating on/with theinternet. Write your own things and run your own projects as you see ﬁt.We can always do more, but it is specious to claim that the core team is standing in the way of meaningfulcontributions to Clojure, as opportunities abound: in library development, outreach, training, tutorials,documentation, giving talks, tool building etc.And yes, on patches to core. Did you know that most patches/issues have poor problem statements, nodescription of the plan (read my code!), no consideration of alternatives, no tests, no designs, and are ill-conceived and/or broken in some way? Community eﬀorts to triage matter a lot in moving things forward -thanks Nicola, Ghadi and many others!The time to re-examine preconceptions about open source is right now. Morale erosion amongst creators isa real thing. Your preconceptions and how you act upon them are your responsibility and yours alone. I amnot going to answer for them or to them.If the way Clojure works isn’t for you, a process which produced Clojure in the ﬁrst place, paradoxically, sobe it. I’m sure you know better about the one true way to write software. But kindly don’t burn thecommunity down on your way out, with self-serving proclamations. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion,but, tragedy of the commons and all that.I encourage everyone gnashing their teeth with negativity at what they think they can’t do instead picksomething positive they can do and do it.Richp.s. My partners and coworkers at Cognitect were not consulted regarding this message - I am certain theywould have dissuaded me. These opinions are mine alone.p.p.s.
